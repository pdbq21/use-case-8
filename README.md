# Use Case #8

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Sure, let's simplify the installation and navigation instructions and add some general run scripts to make it more user-friendly.

## Application Description

Use Case #8 is a straightforward web application designed for collecting and displaying user data. It comprises two primary components: a Form component and a Table component.

The Form component offers a user-friendly interface for entering data, with fields for first name, last name, email, and a message. It incorporates built-in validation to ensure accurate and complete data entry, prompting users to correct any errors before submission. This makes it a reliable tool for collecting precise information.

The Table component serves as a repository for the submitted form data, displaying it in an organized table format for easy review and management. The application is built using React and Redux, ensuring efficient state management and seamless data flow. Whether you need to gather user feedback, collect contact information, or manage various types of data input, the React Redux Form Table App simplifies the process and enhances the user experience.

## Installation and Local Setup

   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

## Running the Application

Once you've completed the installation and setup, you can run the application with the following commands:
